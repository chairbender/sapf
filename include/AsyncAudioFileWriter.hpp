 * A cross-platform alternative to ExtAudioFileWriteAsync.
 * This is NOT thread safe - only one thread should be writing to a given
 * file via this object.
 * Writes the data from RtBuffers to file (one buffer per channel).
 * Use writeAsync to capture the current values in the buffers. The values are stored in a
 * ring buffer and are asynchronously written out to the file.
 * Upon destruction, it blocks until the buffer is flushed.
 * The file is always written in wav format as floats.
